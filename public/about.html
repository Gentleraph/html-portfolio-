<p>Hey, it's Raphael!
  <br> 
I just wanted to tell you about my journey into coding. 
I started Dr. Angela Yu's web development class on January 11, 2024. 
It's pretty cool because, not long ago, coding seemed like this big, confusing thing I couldn't do.
I almost let fear stop me, but I decided to go for it. 
Now, I'm working on projects that felt impossible before. 
It hasn't been super easy, but I'm proud of what I've learned so far.</p>

<p>I want to give a big shoutout to my awesome family for all their encouragement  – My wife, Aunty Nymar and My brother Holo, who told me about this amazing course. 
  And, of course, a huge thanks to Dr. Angela Yu for creating a course that's easy to understand and fun.</p>

<p>If you're reading this and feeling unsure about coding, don't give up! I've been there. Challenge yourself, take a chance, and see where it takes you. 
I'm aiming high – hoping to be a full-stack web developer someday.

  Thanks for being part of my journey! </p>
